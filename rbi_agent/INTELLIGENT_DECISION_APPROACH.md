# Intelligent Decision-Making Approach

## Philosophy Change

**Before**: Prescriptive rules (exit at 0.5%, stop at 0.2%)
**Now**: Enable intelligent LLM decision-making based on context

## Key Principles

### 1. Context-Aware Trading
- LLM should evaluate market regime (trending vs ranging)
- Use Deep42 analysis, sentiment, news to inform decisions
- Make intelligent choices about when to hold vs. take profits

### 2. Let Winners Run
- On strong trend days, let positions run
- Use context (articles, tweets, market conditions) to identify strong days
- Don't force quick exits when momentum suggests continuation

### 3. Volume Through Intelligence
- Trade frequently when high-quality setups align
- Be selective in choppy conditions
- Generate volume through smart trading, not mindless scalping

### 4. Adaptive Decision-Making
- No rigid profit targets or stop losses
- LLM decides based on:
  - Market conditions
  - Volume patterns
  - Sentiment and news
  - Technical signals
  - Deep42 analysis

"Buy when RSI < 30, exit at 0.5% profit or 0.2% stop loss"
```

**New Way** (Intelligent):
```
"Identify oversold conditions (RSI < 30) and evaluate market context:
- Is this a trending market? Let it run if catching trend
- Is this ranging? Consider quick profit
- What does sentiment/Deep42 suggest?
- Evaluate volume patterns
Make intelligent decision about entry size and exit strategy based on all available context"
```
