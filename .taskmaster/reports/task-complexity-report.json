			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Phase 0: Pre-Development API Validation and Environment Setup",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this validation task into specific API testing components: Pacifica /info endpoint validation for all 28 markets, Cambrian batch endpoint testing, pandas_ta library validation, token address mapping creation, and environment setup with proper secret management.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to multiple API validations and dependency testing, but mostly straightforward implementation work with clear validation criteria."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Repository Reorganization: Create LLM Agent Package Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split this reorganization into logical steps: create new package structure with proper directories, move legacy bots safely, update all import statements and dependencies, and verify existing functionality still works after the move.",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity as it's primarily file organization and import updates, but requires careful handling to avoid breaking existing functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Multi-Source Data Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this complex data pipeline into individual fetcher implementations: PacificaDataFetcher for market data, CambrianDataFetcher for token details, OIDataFetcher for open interest, MacroContextFetcher for macro data, error handling and retry logic, and MarketDataAggregator orchestration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple external APIs, error handling requirements, rate limiting, caching, and the need for robust orchestration across different data sources."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Technical Indicators Calculator",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the technical indicators implementation into: dependency setup and configuration, core IndicatorCalculator class with basic indicators (SMA, RSI), advanced indicators (MACD, Bollinger Bands), and data processing pipeline integration.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to mathematical calculations and pandas integration, but leveraging existing ta library reduces complexity significantly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement LLM Client and Decision Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the LLM integration into: ModelClient implementation with authentication and rate limiting, prompt formatting system for market data, response parsing with strict validation, retry logic and error handling, and LLMTradingAgent orchestration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to LLM API integration, prompt engineering, response parsing reliability, and the critical nature of decision-making accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Trade Execution with Risk Management",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split trade execution into critical components: TradeExecutor core implementation, risk management integration with position limits, partial fill handling logic, dry-run mode implementation, take-profit ladder system, stop-loss implementation, and comprehensive logging.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as this involves real money trades, complex risk management, partial fill scenarios, and integration with existing systems while maintaining safety."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Main Bot Loop with Scheduling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize the main bot loop into: scheduling system with configurable intervals, component orchestration and data flow, comprehensive logging system, signal handling for graceful shutdown, and performance monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to orchestration requirements, scheduling reliability, proper shutdown handling, and the need for robust logging across all components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Configuration Management and Environment Handling",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split configuration management into: LLMConfig class design and implementation, environment variable validation system, configuration file templates and examples, and startup validation and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to comprehensive configuration validation and environment handling, but follows established patterns for configuration management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Social Sentiment Integration (Phase 4)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break sentiment integration into: Deep42 API integration and data fetching, sentiment data processing and normalization, LLM prompt enhancement with sentiment context, and performance impact monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to additional API integration and prompt engineering, but marked as low priority suggesting it's an enhancement rather than core functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize error handling into: comprehensive try-catch implementation across all components, exponential backoff and retry mechanisms, graceful degradation strategies, health check and monitoring systems, emergency stop mechanisms, and debugging and logging enhancements.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the comprehensive nature of error handling across the entire system, requiring deep understanding of failure modes and recovery strategies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Performance Monitoring and Analytics System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split analytics into: performance metrics calculation system, decision outcome tracking and analysis, analytics reporting and visualization, backtesting framework implementation, and cost monitoring and optimization.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to comprehensive analytics requirements, backtesting implementation, and the need for meaningful performance metrics calculation."
