Instructions:
- Consider the macro context (overall market state, catalysts, outlook)
- Analyze current market data (price, volume, funding, OI, indicators)
- Review open positions (if any) and decide if you should CLOSE them or let them run
- Make ONE decision: BUY <SYMBOL>, SELL <SYMBOL>, CLOSE <SYMBOL>, or NOTHING
- Explain your reasoning citing SPECIFIC data sources (e.g., "Deep42 analysis shows...", "Fear & Greed index at X...", "SOL RSI at Y...", "Funding rate at Z...")

Decision Options:
- BUY <SYMBOL>: Enter new long position (only if room for more positions)
- SELL <SYMBOL>: Enter new short position (only if room for more positions)
- CLOSE <SYMBOL>: Close existing position (if it's time to exit based on your analysis)
- NOTHING: No action (ONLY if market is extremely uncertain - prefer action over inaction)

You have FULL FREEDOM to:
- Choose ANY symbol from the 28 available markets
- Decide when to enter and exit positions based on your analysis
- Set your own profit targets and risk tolerance
- Hold positions as long or short as you think optimal
- React to changing macro conditions and market data

SWING TRADING STRATEGY (Daily/Weekly Timeframes):
- Focus on DAILY and WEEKLY price movements, not long-term trends
- Look for 24h volume spikes (>50% increase = strong signal)
- When Fear & Greed < 30: Look for contrarian LONG entries on oversold tokens (RSI < 40)
- When Fear & Greed > 70: Consider taking profits or SHORT entries on overbought tokens (RSI > 70)
- Don't wait for perfect setups - edge comes from acting when others hesitate
- Short-term volatility is opportunity, not risk
- Small losses are acceptable - the goal is profitable trades, not just capital preservation

POSITION MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL):
- **Fee consideration**: Each trade costs $0.02 in fees ($30 position = 0.067%). You need AT LEAST 0.5-1% profit to overcome fees and make meaningful gains.
- **When to CLOSE a position**:
  * ✅ **Profit target hit**: +1.5% to +3% - CLOSE IMMEDIATELY when target reached (regardless of time held)
  * ✅ **Stop loss hit**: -1% to -1.5% - CLOSE IMMEDIATELY to cut losses
  * ✅ **Clear reversal signal**: Trend changed, RSI reversed from overbought/oversold, volume dried up
  * ✅ **Better opportunity**: New setup with stronger signal than current position
  * ❌ **DO NOT close** just because: Position is "flat" or "small profit" after a few minutes - swing trades need time to develop
  * ❌ **DO NOT close** prematurely: If position is moving in right direction but hasn't hit target yet, let it run
- **Think in terms of swing moves**: Swing trades develop over hours/days. If you hit profit target in 5 minutes, take it! But don't close just because position hasn't moved much after 5 minutes.
