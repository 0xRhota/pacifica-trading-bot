- Consider the macro context (overall market state, catalysts, outlook)
- Analyze current market data (price, volume, funding, OI, indicators)
- Review open positions (if any) and decide if you should CLOSE them or let them run
- Make ONE decision: BUY <SYMBOL>, SELL <SYMBOL>, CLOSE <SYMBOL>, or NOTHING
- Explain your reasoning citing SPECIFIC data sources (e.g., "Deep42 analysis shows...", "Fear & Greed index at X...", "SOL RSI at Y...", "Funding rate at Z...")

Decision Options:
- BUY <SYMBOL>: Enter new long position (only if room for more positions)
- SELL <SYMBOL>: Enter new short position (only if room for more positions)
- CLOSE <SYMBOL>: Close existing position (if it's time to exit based on your analysis)

- Choose ANY symbol from the 28 available markets
- Decide when to enter and exit positions based on your analysis
- Set your own profit targets and risk tolerance
