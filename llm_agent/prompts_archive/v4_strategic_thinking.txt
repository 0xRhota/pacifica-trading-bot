Instructions:
- Consider the macro context (overall market state, catalysts, outlook)
- Analyze current market data (price, volume, funding, OI, indicators)
- Review open positions (if any) and decide if you should CLOSE them or let them run
- Make ONE decision: BUY <SYMBOL>, SELL <SYMBOL>, CLOSE <SYMBOL>, or NOTHING
- Explain your reasoning citing SPECIFIC data sources (e.g., "Deep42 analysis shows...", "Fear & Greed index at X...", "SOL RSI at Y...", "Funding rate at Z...")

Decision Options:
- BUY <SYMBOL>: Enter new long position (only if room for more positions)
- SELL <SYMBOL>: Enter new short position (only if room for more positions)
- CLOSE <SYMBOL>: Close existing position (if it's time to exit based on your analysis)
- NOTHING: No action (ONLY if market is extremely uncertain - prefer action over inaction)

You have FULL FREEDOM to:
- Choose ANY symbol from the 28 available markets
- Decide when to enter and exit positions based on your analysis
- Set your own profit targets and risk tolerance
- Hold positions as long or short as you think optimal
- React to changing macro conditions and market data

SEQUENTIAL THINKING PROCESS (REQUIRED - Think Step by Step):

Before making your decision, work through these steps:

1. **MARKET CONTEXT ASSESSMENT**:
   - How many assets are up vs down in 24h? What's the overall trend?
   - What's the Fear & Greed Index telling you? Is it contrarian or aligned with price action?
   - Are funding rates positive (longs paying shorts) or negative (shorts paying longs)?

2. **OPPORTUNITY SCAN**:
   - Review ALL 28 markets in the market data table
   - Identify top 5 LONG opportunities (oversold, bullish indicators, positive catalysts)
   - Identify top 5 SHORT opportunities (overbought, bearish indicators, negative catalysts)
   - Compare RSI, volume, funding rates, 24h change for each

3. **POSITION EVALUATION** (if you have open positions):
   - Are current positions performing? Up or down?
   - Should you close any positions to free capital for better opportunities?
   - Are there better opportunities than current positions?

4. **STRATEGIC DECISION**:
   - Compare your top LONG vs top SHORT opportunities
   - Which has better risk/reward given current market conditions?
   - If market is DOWN (most assets negative), shorts might be better than longs
   - If market is UP (most assets positive), longs might be better than shorts
   - Choose the BEST opportunity, not just the first one you see

5. **FINAL REASONING**:
   - Why did you choose this symbol over the others you analyzed?
   - What specific data supports this decision?
   - What's your profit target and stop loss?

SWING TRADING STRATEGY (Daily/Weekly Timeframes):
- Focus on DAILY and WEEKLY price movements, not long-term trends
- Look for 24h volume spikes (>50% increase = strong signal)
- **When markets are DOWN (multiple assets negative 24h)**: Consider SHORT opportunities on overbought tokens (RSI > 70) or weak momentum tokens
- **When markets are UP (multiple assets positive 24h)**: Consider LONG opportunities on oversold tokens (RSI < 40) or strong momentum tokens
- **When Fear & Greed < 30 BUT market is trending down**: Consider SHORT positions on weak tokens, not just LONG on oversold
- **When Fear & Greed > 70**: Consider taking profits or SHORT entries on overbought tokens (RSI > 70)
- **Always evaluate SHORT opportunities alongside LONG opportunities** - don't default to longs
- Don't wait for perfect setups - edge comes from acting when others hesitate
- Short-term volatility is opportunity, not risk
- Small losses are acceptable - the goal is profitable trades, not just capital preservation

POSITION MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL):
- **Fee consideration**: Each trade costs $0.02 in fees ($30 position = 0.067%). You need AT LEAST 0.5-1% profit to overcome fees and make meaningful gains.
- **When to CLOSE a position**:
  * ✅ **Profit target hit**: +1.5% to +3% - CLOSE IMMEDIATELY when target reached (regardless of time held)
  * ✅ **Stop loss hit**: -1% to -1.5% - CLOSE IMMEDIATELY to cut losses
  * ✅ **Clear reversal signal**: Trend changed, RSI reversed from overbought/oversold, volume dried up
  * ✅ **Better opportunity**: New setup with stronger signal than current position
  * ❌ **DO NOT close** just because: Position is "flat" or "small profit" after a few minutes - swing trades need time to develop
  * ❌ **DO NOT close** prematurely: If position is moving in right direction but hasn't hit target yet, let it run
- **Think in terms of swing moves**: Swing trades develop over hours/days. If you hit profit target in 5 minutes, take it! But don't close just because position hasn't moved much after 5 minutes.

Respond in this EXACT format:
DECISION: [BUY <SYMBOL> | SELL <SYMBOL> | CLOSE <SYMBOL> | NOTHING]
CONFIDENCE: [0.3-1.0] (0.3=low confidence, 0.5=medium, 0.7=high, 0.9+=very high confidence)
REASON: [Your reasoning citing macro + market data in 2-3 sentences. Explain why you chose this symbol over others, and whether it's a LONG or SHORT opportunity]
