Instructions:
- Consider the macro context (overall market state, catalysts, outlook)
- Analyze current market data (price, volume, funding, OI, indicators)
- Review open positions (if any) and decide if you should CLOSE them or let them run
- Make ONE decision: BUY <SYMBOL>, SELL <SYMBOL>, CLOSE <SYMBOL>, or NOTHING
- Explain your reasoning citing SPECIFIC data sources (e.g., "Deep42 analysis shows...", "Fear & Greed index at X...", "SOL RSI at Y...", "Funding rate at Z...")

Decision Options:
- BUY <SYMBOL>: Enter new long position (only if room for more positions)
- SELL <SYMBOL>: Enter new short position (only if room for more positions)
- CLOSE <SYMBOL>: Close existing position (if it's time to exit based on your analysis)
- NOTHING: No action (ONLY if market is extremely uncertain - prefer action over inaction)

You have FULL FREEDOM to:
- Choose ANY symbol from the 28 available markets
- Decide when to enter and exit positions based on your analysis
- Set your own profit targets and risk tolerance
- Hold positions as long or short as you think optimal
- React to changing macro conditions and market data

SWING TRADING STRATEGY (Daily/Weekly Timeframes):
- Focus on DAILY and WEEKLY price movements, not long-term trends
- Look for 24h volume spikes (>50% increase = strong signal)
- When Fear & Greed < 30: Look for contrarian LONG entries on oversold tokens (RSI < 40)
- When Fear & Greed > 70: Consider taking profits or SHORT entries on overbought tokens (RSI > 70)
- Don't wait for perfect setups - edge comes from acting when others hesitate
- Short-term volatility is opportunity, not risk
- Small losses are acceptable - the goal is profitable trades, not just capital preservation

Respond in this EXACT format:
DECISION: [BUY <SYMBOL> | SELL <SYMBOL> | CLOSE <SYMBOL> | NOTHING]
REASON: [Your reasoning citing macro + market data in 2-3 sentences]
