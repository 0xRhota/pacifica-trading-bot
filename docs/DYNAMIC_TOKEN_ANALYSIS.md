## Example Decision Cycle

### Inputs Gathered

**1. Custom Macro Query:**
```
Q: "What are the most significant token launches, airdrops, or major protocol
    upgrades happening on Solana today, Thursday, October 30, 2025?"

A: [Deep42 analysis mentioning Solana ETF debut, potential profit-taking, etc.]
```

**2. Tokens Selected by LLM:**
- PUMP
- MEME
- BOME

**3. Token Analyses:**
```
--- PUMP Analysis (Deep42/Cambrian) ---
Sentiment: 96.5% bullish
Recent News: Strong meme momentum, whale accumulation
Technical: Breaking resistance at $0.45
Catalysts: Potential CEX listing rumored
Risks: High volatility, speculative asset

--- MEME Analysis ---
[Similar detailed analysis]

--- BOME Analysis ---
[Similar detailed analysis]
```

**4. Position Evaluations:**
```
(None - no open positions this cycle)
```

**5. Market Data Table:**
```
28 markets with price, volume, funding, OI, RSI, MACD, etc.
```

### LLM Decision:

**Action:** NOTHING

**Reasoning:**
> "The macro context shows a Fear & Greed Index at 34/100 indicating market fear,
> with BTC dominance at 57.88% suggesting capital rotation away from alts. Most
> assets show oversold RSI readings (SOL at 31, ETH at 33) but lack clear bullish
> catalysts, and the Deep42 analysis confirms no major token launches or protocol
> upgrades today to drive momentum. While PUMP shows extremely bullish sentiment
> (96.5%), [...]"

## Benefits

### Before (Fixed 28-Token Analysis)
- Only analyzed Pacifica's 28 markets
- No deep dives on specific tokens
- Generic macro context
- No position re-evaluation

### After (Dynamic Discovery)
- **218 tokens available** (HyperLiquid universe)
- **LLM picks 3 to analyze deeply** each cycle
- Different tokens each time (PUMP, MEME, BOME â†’ SOL, BTC, ETH â†’ ...)
- **Sentiment + news + catalysts** for selected tokens
- **Position re-evaluation** with "close or hold?" advice
- Time-specific intelligence (daily/weekly)

## Example Token Selections

The LLM has full freedom to select any 3 tokens. Examples from different cycles:

**Cycle 1 (Memecoin Focus):**
- PUMP, MEME, BOME

**Cycle 2 (Major + Alts):**
- BTC, ETH, SOL

**Cycle 3 (Trending Narratives):**
- PENGU, HYPE, SUI

**Cycle 4 (Catalyst-Driven):**
- Token with upcoming unlock
- Token with new partnership
- Token with protocol upgrade

## Position Re-evaluation Example

```
--- SOL LONG Position Evaluation (Deep42/Cambrian) ---
Entry: $182.50, Current: $179.20, Time: 3 hours
P&L: -1.81%

Deep42 Evaluation:
"Given SOL's current position near key support at $178, with the Solana ETF
launch creating short-term volatility but strong institutional interest, I
recommend holding this position. The oversold RSI at 31 suggests a potential
bounce, and the -1.81% P&L is within normal pullback range. Consider adding
a stop-loss at $175 (5% drawdown) to protect downside, but the broader trend
remains bullish with $195-200 targets achievable within 48-72 hours if BTC
maintains above $68k."
```

The LLM then uses this evaluation to decide whether to:
- **CLOSE SOL** (take the small loss)
- **NOTHING** (hold the position)
- **BUY more** (if very bullish)
