# When You Wake Up - Quick Status

## Summary

Worked on Lighter integration all night. **Hit SDK bugs** but made significant progress.

---

## Status

✅ **Connection works** - connected to Lighter mainnet
✅ **Account verified** - #126039 has **$433.76** available
✅ **Markets listed** - Found 91 markets including SOL (market_id=2)
✅ **Infrastructure ready** - Health checks, secure logging, all set

❌ **Order placement blocked** - Lighter SDK has critical bugs:
- Wrapper function returns None instead of TxHash
- Market order price validation incorrect
- Order expiry validation failing

---

## What I Did

1. ✅ Fixed Lighter account index (126039, not 0)
2. ✅ Built DEX health check system
3. ✅ Created secure logging (separate files, auto-redacts keys)
4. ✅ Mapped all 91 Lighter markets
5. ✅ Found SOL market specs (min 0.050 SOL, ~$11)
6. ❌ Hit multiple SDK bugs trying to place order

**Documented everything** in `LIGHTER_STATUS.md` (detailed technical breakdown)

## Your Pacifica Bot

**Still running fine!** Made trades while you were afk:

## Next Steps (Pick One)

### Option 1: Quick Manual Test (5 minutes) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
1. Go to https://app.lighter.xyz
2. Connect wallet (account #126039)
3. Place tiny SOL order manually
4. **This proves the account works**

**Then tell me** and I'll:
- Build raw HTTP API solution (bypasses buggy SDK)
- Get automated trading working on Lighter

### Option 2: Skip Lighter For Now
Focus on Pacifica improvements while Lighter SDK matures.

### Option 3: Fork & Fix SDK
Help fix the SDK bugs (I can guide you) and contribute back.
