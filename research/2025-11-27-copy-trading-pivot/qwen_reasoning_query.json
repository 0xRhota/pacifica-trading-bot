FUNDING ARBITRAGE FAILURE\n- Strategy: Delta-neutral between two perp DEXs\n- Results: Lost $17 over 9.5 hours (12.7% of $133 capital)\n- Root causes:\n  a) Position size mismatch (rounding differences)\n  b) Churn mode closed positions every 5 min, missing 8-hour funding settlements\n  c) At $130 capital: Funding income ~$0.007/8hr vs fees ~$0.50/cycle = guaranteed loss\n  d) Need $10k+ minimum capital for funding arb to work\n\n### 2. LLM TRADING BOT FAILURE\n- Win rate: 22.7%\n- Risk/reward: 10% stop-loss, 5% take-profit (backwards 2:1 ratio)\n- Required win rate for breakeven: 68%\n- Actual vs required: 22.7% vs 68% = mathematically guaranteed losses\n- Problems: Counter-trend trading, no confluence, fee blindness\n\n### 3. WINNING WALLET ANALYSIS (75.5% win rate, $668k profit)\n- KEY INSIGHT: NO SCALPING - 90.2% of trades held 4+ hours\n- Average hold time: 93.5 hours (3.9 days)\n- Position sizing: Start $10-50, scale 1000x on conviction\n- This is swing trading, not high-frequency\n\n### 4. COPY TRADING TARGETS FOUND\n- Tool: HyperTracker (app.coinmarketman.com/hypertracker)\n  - Tracks every Hyperliquid wallet in real-time\n  - Cohorts: Money Printer (+$1M), Smart Money ($100k-$1M)\n- Top traders:\n  a) James Wynn: $45M profit, 47% win rate, MEME coins, 40x leverage\n  b) @qwatio: $20M profit, 50x leverage, event-driven (Fed decisions)\n  c) Mystery whale: $8M profit in 1 week, low leverage, ETH/SOL\n- Hyperliquid API: Can query any wallet's fills/positions\n\n### 5. CURRENT CAPITAL: $130\n\n## QUESTIONS FOR DEEP REASONING:\n\n1. Is copy trading the right pivot from funding arbitrage? Why or why not?\n\n2. Given the winning wallet holds 4+ hours (not scalping), should we:\n   a) Copy trade scalpers like @qwatio (50x, short-term)\n   b) Copy trade swing traders like the winning wallet\n   c) Something else entirely?\n\n3. With only $130 capital, what is the MATHEMATICALLY optimal strategy?\n   - Consider: fees, position sizing, win rate requirements, risk of ruin\n\n4. The user originally wanted 'high-volume scalping' - but evidence shows winning traders don't scalp. How do we reconcile this?\n\n5. What are the CRITICAL risks of copy trading that we haven't addressed?\n\n6. Provide a concrete action plan with:\n   - Exact capital allocation\n   - Which wallets/cohorts to copy\n   - Position sizing rules\n   - Risk management rules\n   - Success metrics to track\n\nBe brutally honest. Use chain-of-thought reasoning. Challenge assumptions."
