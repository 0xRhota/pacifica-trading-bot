Use deep reasoning to analyze what went wrong and design something better.\n\n## GOAL:\n- HIGH VOLUME (many trades)\n- PROFITABLE (net positive after fees)\n- Works with $100-500 capital\n- Can run on Hibachi (Solana) and Extended (Starknet) perp DEXs\n\n## WHAT FAILED PREVIOUSLY:\n\n### 1. FUNDING RATE ARBITRAGE\n- Lost $17 in 9.5 hours (12.7% loss)\n- Root cause: $130 capital too small, needed $10k+\n- Churn mode (close/reopen every 5 min) missed funding settlements\n- VERDICT: Mathematically impossible at small scale\n\n### 2. LLM SCALPING BOT (v1-v4)\n- Win rate: 22.7%\n- Risk/Reward: 10% stop-loss, 5% take-profit (BACKWARDS 2:1)\n- Required win rate: 68% (impossible)\n- Problems:\n  a) Counter-trend trading (shorting uptrends)\n  b) Closing winners too early (+0.5% instead of +5%)\n  c) Holding losers hoping for recovery\n  d) Fees eating small wins\n  e) Tight stops (0.5-1%) getting hit by noise\n\n### 3. WINNING WALLET ANALYSIS (75.5% win rate, $668k profit)\n- KEY FINDING: 90% of trades held 4+ HOURS\n- Average hold: 93.5 hours (3.9 days)\n- This is SWING TRADING, not scalping\n- But user wants HIGH VOLUME, not swing trading\n\n## THE CONTRADICTION:\n- User wants HIGH VOLUME (many trades)\n- But evidence shows winning traders hold for HOURS/DAYS\n- Scalping with tight stops = guaranteed losses\n- How do we reconcile this?\n\n## CONSTRAINTS:\n- Fees: ~0.05-0.1% per trade (round trip: 0.1-0.2%)\n- Capital: $100-500\n- Assets: BTC, ETH, SOL (high liquidity)\n- LLM available for decisions (DeepSeek or Qwen)\n- 15-minute candle data from Binance\n- Can trade LONG or SHORT\n\n## QUESTIONS FOR DEEP REASONING:\n\n1. Is \"high volume + profitable\" even possible at $100-500 capital?\n   - If yes, what's the MINIMUM win rate needed?\n   - What R/R ratio works?\n\n2. What timeframe should we use?\n   - 5-min scalping failed\n   - 4-hour+ swing is profitable but low volume\n   - Is there a middle ground?\n\n3. What entry signals actually work for high-frequency?\n   - RSI oversold/overbought?\n   - MACD crossovers?\n   - Volume spikes?\n   - Orderbook imbalance?\n\n4. What exit strategy allows HIGH VOLUME without bleeding fees?\n   - Fixed TP/SL?\n   - Trailing stops?\n   - Time-based exits?\n\n5. Should we use LLM for EVERY trade decision, or just filtering?\n   - LLM is slow (~2-5 sec per query)\n   - LLM costs money per query\n   - Maybe use LLM for market regime, then rule-based entries?\n\n6. Design a CONCRETE strategy that:\n   - Generates 10-50+ trades per day\n   - Has positive expected value after fees\n   - Works with $100-500 capital\n   - Specifies exact entry/exit rules\n   - Includes position sizing\n\nBe brutally honest. If high volume + profit is impossible at this scale, say so. Use chain-of-thought reasoning to explore all angles."
