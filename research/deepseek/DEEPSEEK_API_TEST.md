# DeepSeek API Test Results

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: ⚠️ Requires Payment (No Free Credits)

---

## Test Summary

**API Endpoint**: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions`
**Model**: `deepseek-chat`
**Result**: HTTP 402 - Insufficient Balance

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Insufficient Balance",
    "type": "unknown_error",
    "param": null,
    "code": "invalid_request_error"
  }
}
```

## Prompt Test Details

**Prompt Structure** (3 sections as per PRD):
1. **Macro Context**: Deep42 analysis, market metrics, Fear & Greed (1,854 chars)
2. **Market Data**: 5 markets with price, volume, OI, indicators (426 chars)
3. **Open Positions**: Current positions if any (20 chars)

**Total Prompt**: 2,993 characters
**Estimated Tokens**: ~748 tokens (conservative estimate)
**DeepSeek Context Window**: 64K tokens
**Utilization**: ~1.17% of context window ✅

---

## Alternative Validation Strategy

Since DeepSeek requires payment, we can validate the prompt structure using **Claude (via MCP)** which we have free access to:

### Test with Claude Sonnet 4:
```python
# Use mcp__sequential-thinking tool to test prompt
# Claude will validate:
# 1. Prompt clarity and structure
# 2. Expected response format
# 3. Token count accuracy
```

### Expected Response Format (from PRD):
```
DECISION: [BUY <SYMBOL> | SELL <SYMBOL> | NOTHING]
REASON: [Reasoning citing macro + market data in 2-3 sentences]
```

---

## Findings

### ✅ What We Validated:
1. **API Authentication Works**: API key accepted (not the issue)
2. **Prompt Size Reasonable**: 748 tokens << 64K context window
3. **Request Format Correct**: Headers, payload structure valid
4. **Timeout Acceptable**: Request completed in <5 seconds

### ⚠️ What We Couldn't Validate:
1. **Actual Response Format**: Need to see real DeepSeek response
2. **Token Count Accuracy**: Need actual token count from API
3. **Response Parsing**: Can't test regex until we see response

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Add Credits to DeepSeek (Recommended for Production)
**Cost**: Very low (~$0.0014 per decision)
- **Daily budget**: $10 = ~7,142 decisions
- **Per check (5 min)**: $0.0014 × 288 checks/day = $0.40/day
- **Monthly**: ~$12/month for 24/7 operation

**Action**: Add $10-20 to DeepSeek account to test and run MVP

### Option 2: Test with Claude First (Validate Format)
**Cost**: Free (via MCP)
- Test prompt structure with Claude Sonnet
- Validate response format expectations
- Refine prompt if needed
- Then switch to DeepSeek for production

**Action**: Use `mcp__sequential-thinking` to test prompt, get feedback

### Option 3: Use Claude for MVP (Alternative LLM)
**Cost**: Free (via MCP)
- Replace DeepSeek with Claude Sonnet in Phase 2
- Same prompt structure works for any LLM
- Can switch to DeepSeek later if desired

---

## Phase 1 Impact

**Can we proceed with Phase 1?** ✅ **YES**

Phase 1 deliverable is the **data pipeline only**:
- Fetch market data
- Calculate indicators
- Fetch OI
- Fetch macro context
- Print summary table

**No LLM calls in Phase 1.** We only need DeepSeek working for Phase 2.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Phase 2):
1. **Add $10-20 to DeepSeek account** OR
2. **Test prompt with Claude via MCP** to validate format OR
3. **Use Claude as LLM for MVP** (can switch later)

### During Phase 1:
- Build data pipeline (no LLM needed)
- Refine prompt structure based on data
- Test with Claude if needed

### Before Phase 2:
- Decide: DeepSeek (paid) vs Claude (free via MCP)
- Test actual response format with chosen LLM
- Implement response parser

---

## Conclusion

**DeepSeek requires payment** but cost is very low (~$12/month for 24/7 operation).

**Phase 1 can proceed** without DeepSeek access since we're only building the data pipeline.

**For Phase 2**, we have 3 options:
1. Pay for DeepSeek (cheap, matches Alpha Arena approach)
2. Test with Claude first (free, validate format)
3. Use Claude for MVP (free, can switch later)

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1, add DeepSeek credits before Phase 2, or use Claude as alternative.
