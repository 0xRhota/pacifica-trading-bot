### Alpha Arena Data Parity ✅ ACHIEVED

All 6 data sources from winning strategy (+125% returns):

- ✅ **Funding rates** (Pacifica `/info`)
- ✅ **Open Interest** (Binance + HyperLiquid)
- ✅ **Volume** (Pacifica `/kline`)
- ✅ **RSI** (calculated with `ta`)
- ✅ **MACD** (calculated with `ta`)
- ✅ **EMA/SMA** (calculated with `ta`)

### Macro Context Integration ✅ NEW ADDITION

- ✅ Deep42 analysis (market state, catalysts, outlook)
- ✅ CoinGecko metrics (market cap change, BTC dominance)
- ✅ Fear & Greed Index (sentiment score)
- ✅ 12-hour cache strategy (reduces API calls)
- ✅ Integration example created (`research/example_llm_bot_with_macro.py`)

---

## Security & Risk Controls ✅ DEFINED

### Security Measures
- ✅ Input sanitization (prevent LLM prompt injection)
- ✅ Daily spend limit ($10/day for DeepSeek API)
- ✅ MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=3 limit enforced
- ✅ API Agent Keys (separate from main wallet)
- ✅ Secrets in .env (not in code)

### Risk Management
- ✅ Stop loss: 1% (BotConfig.STOP_LOSS)
- ✅ Take profit: 3-level ladder [2%, 4%, 6%]
- ✅ Position sizing: Fixed $30-40 per trade
- ✅ Max open positions: 3
- ✅ Partial fill handling defined

---

## Architecture Clarity ✅ WELL-DEFINED

### Prompt Structure (3 Sections)
1. **Macro Context** (cached 12 hours)
   - Deep42 market analysis
   - Quick metrics (market cap, BTC dominance, Fear & Greed)
2. **Market Data Table** (fresh per cycle)
   - All 28 markets with: Price, Volume, OI, Funding, RSI, MACD, SMA
3. **Open Positions** (if any)
   - Symbol, entry price, current P&L, time held

### Decision Loop Flow
```
1. Get macro context (from cache or refresh if >12h)
2. Fetch market data for all 28 symbols
3. Calculate indicators (RSI, MACD, SMA)
4. Fetch OI data (Binance + HyperLiquid)
5. Format prompt with macro + market + positions
6. Query DeepSeek LLM
7. Parse response (DECISION: BUY/SELL/NOTHING)
8. Execute trade if decision made
9. Wait 5 minutes, repeat
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Pre-Development Validation ✅ COMPLETE
- All data sources tested
- All APIs working
- Coverage validated
- No blockers identified

### Phase 1: Basic Data Pipeline (Next)
**Goal**: Fetch and format all market data

**Components to build**:
- [ ] `PacificaDataFetcher` (OHLCV + funding)
- [ ] `OIDataFetcher` (Binance + HyperLiquid)
- [ ] `MacroContextFetcher` (Deep42 + CoinGecko + Fear & Greed)
- [ ] `IndicatorCalculator` (RSI, MACD, SMA using `ta`)
- [ ] `MarketDataAggregator` (combine all sources)
- [ ] Input sanitization layer

**Deliverable**: Script that prints summary table with all data

**Estimated Scope**: ~5 classes, ~500-700 lines of code

### Phase 2: LLM Integration
**Goal**: Query DeepSeek continuously, log every decision

**Components to build**:
- [ ] `DeepSeekClient` (API wrapper with spend limit)
- [ ] `PromptFormatter` (3-section prompt builder)
- [ ] `ResponseParser` (strict regex parsing)
- [ ] Decision logging system
- [ ] Main loop with 5-minute checks

**Deliverable**: Bot that monitors market and logs decisions

**Estimated Scope**: ~4 classes, ~400-500 lines of code

### Phase 3: Trade Execution
**Goal**: Execute LLM decisions via PacificaSDK

**Components to build**:
- [ ] `TradeExecutor` (integrates with existing SDK)
- [ ] Position tracking
- [ ] 3-level ladder TP system
- [ ] Partial fill handling
- [ ] Dry-run mode

**Deliverable**: Fully automated trading bot

**Estimated Scope**: ~3 classes, ~300-400 lines of code

### Phase 4: Social Sentiment (Optional)
**Goal**: Add Deep42 social sentiment to prompt

**Scope**: Add sentiment columns to market table

**Estimated Scope**: ~100 lines of code

## Critical Path Items

### Before Starting Phase 1
- ✅ DeepSeek API key added to .env
- ✅ Phase 0 validation complete
- ✅ All data sources tested
- ✅ PRD reviewed and finalized

### During Phase 1
- Test DeepSeek API with free credits
- Validate prompt size (<8K tokens)
- Confirm 12-hour macro cache works
- Test OI fetcher with all 28 markets

### Before Phase 2
- Confirm DeepSeek responses are parseable
- Test daily spend limit check
- Validate response format enforcement

### Before Phase 3 (Production)
- Extensive dry-run testing
- Validate all error handling
- Test partial fill scenarios
- Confirm stop-loss triggers correctly

## Known Limitations & Mitigations

### Limitations
1. **kBONK, kPEPE lack OI data** (2/28 markets)
   - Mitigation: Log warning, proceed without OI for these tokens

2. **Cambrian token data limited** (1/28 tokens mapped)
   - Mitigation: Phase 1 MVP doesn't require Cambrian data
   - Future: Add token addresses incrementally

3. **DeepSeek API free credits limited**
   - Mitigation: Start testing with free credits, upgrade to paid if needed
   - Cost: ~$0.0014 per decision (very cheap)

4. **Macro context 12-hour cache**
   - Mitigation: Force refresh option available if major news breaks
   - User can manually trigger refresh

### Non-Blocking Issues
- Deep42 social sentiment not critical for MVP
- Cambrian data nice-to-have, not required
- Token address mapping can be added later
